# battleship
Description: The program first reads in a placement file, classifies
each inputted ship and allocates them to their desired position on
the 10x10 grid. Next, the program takes an inputted guess file and
reads in each guess from the user. Indication is given if the guess
hits a ship's position, or if it hits nothing. After all of a
ship's position are hit, it is sunk. After all ship's have sunk,
the program ends. Error messages are placed throughout the program
in case the inputs given fall out of the program's parameters.
